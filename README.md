## What?

Interactive visualization(s) of Pokemon-related data. Right now there's only one but I plan to add more.

## Why?

I want to get better at data-viz. Pokemon has tons of data to experiment with. Eventually I'd like to have a whole suite of visualizations.

## How?

The tools that I plan on using are

- Svelte
- D3
